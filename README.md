# INCS Task

The goal of this task is to review the provided data to determine which Senators would be easiest to target for changing their “Y”, “NV”, or “P” vote to a “N” vote for bill HB 768. In order to gain a majority vote, 13 Senators would need to change their votes. I was asked to review: “which ones could be persuaded by performance or constituent data from their district that suggests their constituents currently benefit from charter schools or would be served by more high-quality school options.” Based on my analysis I would recommend targeting Republicans and then Districts in Chicago ordered by a combination of the following features: number of charter students, number of charter schools, number of high performing schools (good standing), and number of low performing schools (schools at the support-level.)

In this repo you will find the following:

2. An [excel document](https://github.com/jordanhowesnelson/incs-task/blob/master/incs-task-prioritization.xls) with the Senate Districts ranked by lobbying prioritization. *Please note that some of the sample sizes used for this analysis are small and some of these results are not statistically significant.
